            <p>Eating a healthy diet is not about strict limitations, staying unrealistically thin, or depriving
                yourself of the foods you love.</p>

            <h1>About Me</h1>

            <p>Since our modest beginnings in 2005 with a little space in Torontoâ€™s stylish Yorkville locale,
                Food 404's development has been enlivened with the energy to cook and serve solid,
                Indian-roused takeout food. In contrast to other Indian eateries, Food 404 was made with the
                explicit expectation to appear as something else.</p>

        <h2>My Recipes</h2>
        <p>An entry in My Recipes can be any combination of different foods you choose. It can be simple, like a turkey
            sandwich (consisting of one slice of turkey plus two slices of rye bread), or more complex, such as a
            casserole dish with many ingredients. If you choose, a recipe can also represent a meal (for example,
            "breakfast" consisting of two eggs, toast, coffee, and juice).
